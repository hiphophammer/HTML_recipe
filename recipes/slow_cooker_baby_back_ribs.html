    <title>Slow Cooker Baby Back Ribs Recipe</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These baby back ribs cooked in a crockpot are the best I've had, short of the actual grilling method of course! This is a very simple recipe that I came up with a few years ago. It's not rocket science, just ribs cooked in the slow cooker and finished with barbeque sauce in the oven. This is what I do when I want ribs during the week and have to work all day. I'm eating them within 30 minutes of getting home, and they turn out perfect every time!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 pounds baby back ribs, trimmed</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Â½ onion, sliced</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (18 ounce) bottle barbeque sauce</li>
        </ul>
